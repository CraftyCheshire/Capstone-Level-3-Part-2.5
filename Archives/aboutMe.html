      <h2>About the Author</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Savannah Nykole Holmes, though most people call me Vann. I
        was born and raised in the heart of Memphis, Tennessee, a city rich with
        music, history, and culture. However, my life’s rhythm was shaped by
        something quite different—technology. Ever since I can remember, I’ve
        been fascinated by computers and gadgets. If it ticked, clicked, or
        powered up, it captured my attention. I spent countless hours exploring
        the inner workings of electronics, enthralled by the way they functioned
        and connected the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        My love for computers and technology became a refuge from the challenges
        of my early life. Growing up was not easy, as I faced a childhood marked
        by trauma that left deep emotional scars. But through the tough times, I
        found solace in learning and seeking approval, especially from my
        teachers. Education became my safe space, and I threw myself into it
        wholeheartedly. I worked hard, not just to succeed academically, but to
        earn the validation and encouragement from teachers that I craved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Driven by a need to prove myself and find a sense of accomplishment, I
        aimed to please and always went the extra mile in my schoolwork. Whether
        it was solving a complex math problem or mastering a new computer
        program, I thrived on the satisfaction of achieving something difficult.
        The digital world gave me control and predictability—something my early
        life often lacked.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite the shadows of my past, I’ve used those experiences to fuel my
        growth. I continue to seek out challenges that inspire me, always aiming
        to push boundaries and break through limitations. Technology still
        inspires me, and I remain committed to learning, exploring, and
        mastering the ever-evolving digital landscape.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am Vann, a survivor, a seeker, and a creator, shaped by the past but
        always looking ahead toward a brighter future.
